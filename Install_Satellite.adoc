[IMPORTANT]
You can find your Cluster Asset ID by looking into the Cluster `Asset ID` field information on the Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory.

* Step 3 - Copy the Helm chart and run it at your cluster.

[WARNING]
A unique identifier is generated at each time a helm chart is generated and it acts as a cluster identifier, therefore you cannot reuse the helm chart across different clusters.

Right after the helm chart is generated, your cluster will be on `Pending` state, until Satellite gets deployed and starts reporting to Prisma Cloud

After the deployment is done, the cluster status will change to a `Ready`
state.

Once a cluster moves to a `Ready` state, it will continuously sending keep-alives to Prisma Cloud every 30 minutes. If there's a communication issue or if the Satellite gets removed, the object will move into a `Offline` state until the communication is reestablished or the Satellite object is deleted in the Prisma Cloud console.
