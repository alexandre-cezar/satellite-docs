= Automating Satellite Deployments
Alexandre Cezar <acezar@paloaltonetworks.com> 1.0, August 31, 2023:

==  Prerequisites
- Ensure `kubectl` is installed and configured to interact with your K8s cluster.
- Ensure `curl` is installed for making API requests.
- Ensure `helm` is installed if the install script is a Helm chart or requires Helm for deployment.
- Ensure you have the required access token or temp API key for authentication.

== Automation Script Steps

1. Download the link:scripts/satellite_onboarding.sh[sample install script]
2. Update `API_HOST` and `AUTH_TOKEN`
3. Execute the script from the terminal, passing the `clusterAssetId` as an argument.

```bash
    chmod +x satellite_onboarding.sh
    ./satellite_onboarding.sh arn:aws:eks:us-east-2:12654563:cluster/demo-eks-cluster
```
This process will interact with the PrismaCloud API to onboard the cluster as well as deploy the satellite component within the designated cluster.
