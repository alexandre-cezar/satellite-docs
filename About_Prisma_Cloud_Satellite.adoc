== About

Prisma Cloud Satellite is an operator designed to manage and orchestrate the deployment of Prisma Cloud functions required for different aspects of K8s Visibility, Monitoring and Posture.

Customers can easily install the Satellite using their traditional deployment mechanisms and start getting visibility over their K8s clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
Satellite does not have any enforcement security capabilities, and it's not an alternative for Prisma Cloud Defender as both tools serve different purposes.
